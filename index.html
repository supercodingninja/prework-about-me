      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I TRULY BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD LEARN TO CODE (I plan to teach my children). I am actively pursing courses; and even self-studies of my own. My goal is to be a full-stack developer.

As I told a party before, "This is not </>, this is not the <...> of the </>, it is only the </> of the <...>."</p>

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm a little, "Out of this world."
When you're passionate about something, it's no longer your craft: you're an artist expressing your art. Ninjas are not skillful because they learn a skill, they are passionate warriors who define and master the art; all the while, creating an art of their own mastery. I Am The Super Coding Ninja!</p>

      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>'m well-versed: I love playing various types of saxophones; especially for GOD! I love motivating people, I love Changing My World, Daily. I learn new customs in other cultures and common phrases of other languages. I like playing football, rugby, soccer, and hockey. I learn wrestling and mixed martial arts. I practice home defense safely, with rifles and pistols, at ranges that uphold the safest standards possible. I sing casually and formally. I like watching skydivers and extreme sports. I live my life; and I love it: I don't let social or political extremes and norms dictate how I live; because I have a moral compass, which causes me to naturally treat my fellow person with respect, as I believe GOD desires.</p>

      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>"The Guy in the Chair," lol!  No, my dream job is not a profession; but a possession: I desire to be a full-time preacher, even a Pastor!  I am an active minister, currently assigned to the Graham, WA location, for my church organization. I currently am involve in our music program (vocal and instrumental). I was an active staff member (groundskeeper) for nearly six (6) consecutive years. In lieu of both, ministerial and economic goals, and a wonderful family editions (my beautiful daughter and son), and becoming chronically ill, I chose to pursue another employment. It is my desire, to be fit for a pastorate office, one day- a calling not to be taken lightly.</p>

      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Definitely, not on Earth: I believe in making the impossible Possible!  Why: "IT'S POSSIBLE!"- Les Brown  Les Brown once quoted Marian Wright Edelman, “Service is the rent we pay for being. It is the very purpose of life, and not something you do in your spare time.”...he later said, "How many of you know people behind their rent- raise your hand! Some of you raising your hand because it's you..." I have determined to make sure my rent is paid, daily.</p>

      <p class="finale"><h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1><p>
      <p>The world need coders!  Our digital age is growing more rapid than the "dot com" era of my youth.  I have found the best way to win, is with a winning team: a team that is synergestic; and laughs at the odds! Service is everything; and we must serve one another.  When I code, I can use technology and create beautiful projects; which amplify my life or others, while showcasing myself/others to an audience who we may not be able to be physically reached (I can exclaim who and what someone/I am about). As it's probably best and commonly define, thus far, "Someone who solves a problem, that you didn't know you had, in a way you don't understand."  I do not want to be known as a coding ninja; rather a Super Coding Ninja: I want to be recognized for my work, and working effectively- always looking for solutions; and a better way of doing things. I want my peer to count on me; and I want to make a difference both, my own life, and the lives of others.</p>
